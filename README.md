# Permit_Pro
TLDR: A app for clear insight into what fish or game can or cannot be harvest at a specific time, and what probability for drawing a permit for a specific game at any given time.

Monorepo:
This is the monorepo for all code needd to run Permit_Pro! Permit_Pro is a mobile first designed app that scraps state fish and game department websites and deduces insights from publicly listed calendants, pdfs, and websites. The goal is to have a easy to use app, with a map that has units listed and then allows users to click on a area, select a game animal and method of take, and tell them immedialty if they can participate with or without a permit. 

TODO to build this are:
  1.) Website scrapper for the state of California
  2.) LLM to analyze the pdf and information on the calendars
  3.) DB to hold information of locaitons, game types, size limits, and methods of take
  4.) A front end with a map that allows a user to see this information in a easy to use and friently way.

Langeges to use are Typescrit with react for front end
Python for back end
SQL for database interaciton
